$Hello friend! <br>

In this repo I gonna share all my excercises on Data Structures and their Algorithms.
The idea behind this daily exercises are simple to develop my analytical skills on Data Structure, learn how to use them efficiently and of course to become a better developer.
<br>
I'm using C for the exercises, because C is awesome and it's the best way to really learn and understand the implementation of Data Structures and their Algorithms.
